Through our analysis, it was difficult to understand whether the MSA amendments had any impact. 

By only using datasets that are directly related to the fishing industry it we could not be sure whether the MSA amendments were responsible for changes in the fish stock, GDP or employment in the fisheries industry. We also discovered that the fishing sector is responsible for quite a small portion of the economies of most coastal counties -- by GDP and employment measures. However, this may simply be because the county geography is too coarse. Since counties were defined by population counts, some counties stretch over extensive geographies. In addition, although fisheries may make up a small portion of a county's economy, does not mean that the industry is not important to specific towns and small economic contributions should not undermine the cultural ad lifestyle relevance of the fishing industry to coastal communities. 

However, through the process we did learn more about the North Atlantic's fishing industry -- including how they collect data and the way the data is measured. And were able to understand that over time, the fishing industry in the US is shrinking, despite amendments to the MSA.
