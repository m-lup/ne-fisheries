<p>The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) is the primary law responsible for commercial fishery management in the United States. First passed in 1976, the MSA aims to: </p>
   1. prevent overfishing, 
   2. rebuild overfished stocks, 
   3. ensure a safe and sustainable seafood supply, 
   4. increase long-term economic and social benefit, and 
   5. <span style="color:dark grey">protect fish habitats needed for spawning, breeding, feeding, and growing to maturity.</span>

<p>The federal government reauthorized and strengthened the MSA in 2007. The updated act included amendments to the [moratorium on the use of driftnets](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/01/12/2011-507/high-seas-driftnet-fishing-moratorium-protection-act-identification-and-certification-procedures-to), strenthening international fisheries management organizations and directed the US to address illegal fishing and bycatch of protected marine life.

In 2018, the MSA was further amended by the Modernizing Recreational Fisheries Management Act to improve the accountability of mixed-use fisheries (companies that have commercial and recreational operations). </p>
