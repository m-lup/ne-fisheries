    "text": "Through our analysis, it was difficult to understand whether the MSA amendments had any impact.\nBy only using datasets that are directly related to the fishing industry it we could not be sure whether the MSA amendments were responsible for changes in the fish stock, GDP or employment in the fisheries industry. We also discovered that the fishing sector is responsible for quite a small portion of the economies of most coastal counties – by GDP and employment measures. However, this may simply be because the county geography is too coarse. Since counties were defined by population counts, some counties stretch over extensive geographies. In addition, although fisheries may make up a small portion of a county’s economy, does not mean that the industry is not important to specific towns and small economic contributions should not undermine the cultural ad lifestyle relevance of the fishing industry to coastal communities.\nHowever, through the process we did learn more about the North Atlantic’s fishing industry – including how they collect data and the way the data is measured. And were able to understand that over time, the fishing industry in the US is shrinking, despite amendments to the MSA.",

    "text": "Analysis\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Timeframe\n\nTo reiterate, we are hoping to identify trends in fish stock and fisheries livelihoods before and after the two recent amendments to the MSA, in 2007 and 2018. The data we selected begins before the amendments came into effect and ends with the most recent data available. However, we are constrained by the data available through NOAA’s Economics: National Ocean Watch and NOAA’s StockSMART databases. These two datasets are the most comprehensive publically-accessible repositories on the US ocean economy and fisheries resource management. The most recent data available is from 2021 and 2022, respectively. As such, we are generally looking at the time period between 2005 and 2022, with analysis related to the ocean economy stopping at 2021.\n\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\n\nIn the first part of our analysis, we looked at the impacts of the two recent MSA amendments in 2007 and 2018. To do this, we found data for fish stock assessments, fish haul, GDP, and fisheries employment. We began at the scale of the full region from Delaware to Maine to see whether any correlations arose at the regional level following either of the policy amendments. The fish stock assessment data was downloaded from NOAA StockSMART. Data was downloaded for the two marine ecosystems relevant to the north Atlantic: Atlantic Highly Migratory and Northeast Shelf Species. Given the inconsistent nature of these assessment records, each asssessment used a different unit to calculate biomass. Therefore, we chose to use B/Bmsy which is a ratio of the current estimated biomass during each assessment verses the established sustainable biomass threshold for the given species. Next, we looked at the state-by-state scale to further understand any patterns correlated to the 2007 and 2018 policy amendments. To analyze the state-scale data, we compared the medians for 2005-2007, 2008-2018, and 2019-2022 for fish haul by state, GDP per capita, and employment in fisheries. These datasets were then mapped using AltAir hconcat().\nThe second part of our analysis asked where the current most important areas are for the fishing industry along the north Atlantic US coast. We were interested to look at this question across a range of parameters to see how the answer may shift based upon the data input. Because we were interested in understanding the current condition, we used data from 2022. The data was then mapped on one figure using Alt.Layer and the toggle function to view the differences between each dataset as an indicator of regions of fishing importance. The four datasets used were:\n\n1. County-scale GDP per capita from fisheries as a percent of the total county-scale GDP per capita (BEA, US Census)\n2. County-scale employment in fisheries as a percent of total employment (BEA, NOAA)\n3. Number of registered fishing vessels which hail from each port (NOAA Fisheries, US Census)\n4. Landings/fish haul in pounds per state (NOAA Fisheries)\n\nAccessing Data with API requests: NOAA Fisheries provides national data on landings (otherwise undestood as fish haul) and registered fishing vessel activity. Landings/fish haul was used to understand potential impact from the MSA policy and to assess regions of importance in the north Atlantic United States. However, due to commercial confidentiality, the landings data is limited because it is only provided at a state scale. The fishing vessel data was used to assess important ports in the north Atlantic US by analyzing the number of vessels which hail from a given port in our region of interest. Data was accessed from NOAA Fisheries using an API request for each dataset, filtered by our states of interest and study timeframe. The landings/fish haul data was then grouped by year and state. The vessels data used the hail port name to spatially join with US Census Place names. We found the the vast majority for hail port locations matched exactly to a US Census Place given the majority of ports are named after the city they are located within. Once this was complete, the total number of vessels per port could be counted.\n\n\n\nDatasets Used\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) GDP data for state and county. https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp.\nBureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) employment data for NAICS 1141 - Fishing by state and county, 2005 to 2022. https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm.\nNOAA Economics: National Ocean Watch ocean economy employment and GDP by state and county from 2005 to 2021. https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/enow.html.\nNOAA Fisheries vessel landings, landings by top US ports and vessel density by state from 2005 to 2022. https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/f?p=215:11:8262191115478.

    "text": "Introduction\nCommercial fishing is a key industry in the Northeast. Historically, fisheries were the primary employer in many towns, and cities grew up around the industry. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, commercial fishing had periods of boom and bust leading to declining towns and depopulation along the coast. Despite these fluctuations, commercial fishing is still important to the region both economically and culturally. The industry also has significant environmental externalities, including pollution, trophic system collapse and ocean warming. Managing fishery operations is essential to ensure long term resource availability but can have negative impacts in the short term on the economic viability of businesses. This is a question of balancing economy and livelihoods with sustainability.\nTo this end, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) is the primary law responsible for commercial fishery management in the United States. The federal government passed the act in 1976, and reauthorized it in 2007 and 2018. At the time of both re-authorizations, the federal government incorporated additional regulations. We are keen to understand what impacts the 2007 and 2018 amendments to the MSA have had on coastal communities in the Northeast and if the amendments were successful in conserving Atlantic fish stocks.
