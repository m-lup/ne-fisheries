### Analysis Timeframe
<p>To reiterate, we are hoping to identify trends in fish stock and fisheries livelihoods before and after the two recent amendments to the MSA, in 2007 and 2018. The data we selected begins before the amendments came into effect and ends with the most recent data available. However, we are constrained by the data available through [NOAA's Economics: National Ocean Watch](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/enow.html) and [NOAA's StockSMART databases](https://apps-st.fisheries.noaa.gov/stocksmart?app=homepage). These two datasets are the most comprehensive publically-accessible repositories on the US ocean economy and fisheries resource management. The most recent data available is from 2021 and 2022, respectively. As such, we are generally looking at the time period between 2005 and 2022, with analysis related to the ocean economy stopping at 2021. </p>
