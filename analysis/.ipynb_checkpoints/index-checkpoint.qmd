Analysis Timeframe
To reiterate, we are looking at identify trends we will need to look at data for a period that begins before the amendments came into effect and ends with the most recent data available. However, we are constrained by the data available through NOAA's StockSMART database - the most publically-accessible comprehensive repository on fisheries resource management. As such, we are looking at the time period between 2005 and 2022.
